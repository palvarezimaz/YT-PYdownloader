# Python YOUTUBE downloader

This very small Python program uses the pytube library to ease the download of YouTube videos to my computer using the CLI, so I can stop using dodgy plugins.

To make it work, you need to install pytube:

`pip install pytube`

And, of course, have Python3 installed.

I want to thank all those annonymous heroes that put code online, daily, as it was the internet who guided me to make this code and this short program a working one.
